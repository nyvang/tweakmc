            The Vehicle part of the system covers 3 (at the moment) different types of vehicles. These are ATV, Motorbike and Other. <br>
            Please note, that more can be added by simply typing into the Vehicle drop down box.
        </p>

        <p>In the vehicle interface, vehicles are strangely enough beeing created in the system. <br>
            Under the second tab, we can either search or edit a vehicle that is founf in the database.<br>

        The first pane - Create vehicle - have some different fields where only the ones marked with * are allways required to save.
        <br>The illustration is shown below:<br><br>

        The Owner interface is very similar to the Vehicle, as they basically are doing the same functions just with different names. <br>
        Their biggest difference is the names of the fields that contain the specific information.<br>
        The second pane - Search/Edit Owner - have a little different layout than the similar Create Vehicle, as the options here are <br>
        increased a little. The illustration is shown below:<br><br>

        As You might have spotted, we now have the abillity to attach a Vehicle to an Owner. This is a very important core feature for <br>
        the rest of the system. As we ofcourse want to know who owns the Vehicle.. :)


        <p>This was a brief walk-through for the Create Vehicle and Order features. In the next chapter we will take a look at the Order part.</p>
