        One of the most basically features of the system are the Order interface. This is ofcourse whats it all about.<br>
        As we take a close look on the order system, we have some fields that can be customized to the wich of the user. <br>
        This is mainly the orderdescription and sparepartsdescription, but also the expected end price can be filled out as the user see fit. <br>
        This is for giving the best possibillity for choosing the right informations from order to order.<br>
        Another interesting thing here is the datepicker that automaticly opens a calendar for choosing the right start date and an expected end date. <br>
        These informations are very important for autogenerating the next order feature, the todo-list.<br>
        

        Just like Vehicle and Owner, the Order can be found by searching and selected/enabled for editing. The illustration is shown below:<br>

        <h3>The weekly todo-list</h3><br>


        <p>
        For the grand overview of the upcomming orders, the Order interface has a functionallity that at any given date, will generate a list <br>
        over all orders starting and/or ending within the next seven days from the present day. Using this feature, the planning will run a bit more smooth.
        The illustration is shown below:<br></p>
        <img src="todo.jpg" alt="On-screen todo-list for 7 days forth" align="CENTER"><br><br>
        <b>Note: The list is calculating the date from the current time and date of the system on which the system is running. <br>This mean, that a mistake can happen if the time and date if off.</b><br><br>
