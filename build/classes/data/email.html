          <b>E-mail (as technicial helper)</b>
        <p>
        If the user encounters unexpected errors that cannot be solved by the user or system administrator, the E-mail system can be very helpful.<br>
        </p>
        All relevant parts of the system is designed to report any errors that comes up. <br>
        The different parts will write the error message together with the name of the precise part that have failed. <br>
        This, together with a specific time and date will help the system engineers to identify and resolve the issue.<br>
        The system logs all attempted logins aswel as the succesful ones for better overview of a the context of the error.<br>
        <br>
        The progress bar indicates the process of sending the log-file to the engineers<br>

        <h3>E-mail (as a service for customers)</h3>

        <p>
        Another feature that the system provides, is the possibillity of sending an email directly to a user-specified email adress, which could be the owner of a bike. <br>
        There is a stand-alone interface for this function where the user can write some text and a email adress. <br> The intention of this feature is to send copies of f.x. the order note or the measruements.
        Although the attach-file feature has not been implemented yet.<br>

        The interface for the service email can be seen on the image below<br>

        Note: The interface is allso used for sending user specific error descriptions to the developers, which is why there are "error-test" all over the interface.
